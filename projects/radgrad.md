engagement, retention, and diversity in undergraduate STEM majors."

The fundamental goal of the RadGrad Project is to provide students, faculty, and advisors with an alternative perspective on
the undergraduate degree program---which traditionally boils down to a single kind of activity (coursework) and a single metric 
for success (grade point average).

Out alternative perspective is called the RadGrad Degree Experience, and it gives first class status to both curricular 
activities (courses) and extracurricular activites (discipline-oriented events, activities, clubs, etc.).
